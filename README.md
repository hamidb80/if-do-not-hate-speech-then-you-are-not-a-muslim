Brothers and sisters, as you know for sure, there is concept of "hating the enemy of God" in
Islam and even **christianity**.

One of the pillars of Islam 
- is called "تولی" meaning "loving who God loves" and 
- another one is called "تبری" which means "Hating the enemies of God"


 As a muslim, you have to show publicly your fondness and your hatred. 
 one of the examples of showing hatred is express hatred through hate speech. 
 Currently whats going on in Palestine and Lebanon, is against humanity and certainly
 God hates it.

 As a human first and then as a muslim, it is your duty to hate speech and 
 spread hate of the "occupied palestine" to the public, otherwise you'll be known guilty by Allah. 
 yes Allah hates who is silent about killing innocent women and children. 

 Sure the president and goverment of so called "muslim countries" like Turkey, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, ... who help 
 Israel by exporting lots of foods and facilities, are not muslims; as they help enemy of God

 ِDo not fear of being banned as Allah said in his Quran ( [Surah 4 Ayah 134](https://quran.com/en/an-nisa/134) ):

> Whoever desires the reward of this world, then ˹let them know that˺ with Allah are the rewards of this world and the Hereafter. And Allah is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.
